## General info

This project, carried out as part of the [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) training, aims to put into practice our knowledge in React on the frontend part.

The Vinted Clone project is composed of 2 parts the backend and the frontend (application treated here).
The latter is the website for managing offers.

This project, with a pedagogical aim, should allow us to put forward our knowledge to employers.

## Overview

This application is composed of 6 pages, 2 of which need to be authenticated (the creation and purchase of an offer).

The main page presents the list of the 10 first offers. At this level, the user can :

- search or filter the offers and change the display sorting
- navigate to other offers
- consult the details of an offer and access the purchase screen
- access the offer creation screen
- authenticate with your user account
- create a new user account
